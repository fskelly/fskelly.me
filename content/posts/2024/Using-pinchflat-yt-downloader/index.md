I am an avid listener to the [Self-Hosted Podcast](https://selfhosted.show/) and on a [recent episode](https://selfhosted.show/134) they made mention of a new tool [Pinchflat](https://github.com/kieraneglin/pinchflat). So I decided to give it a try. I have starred the repo already, this is a great way to support the open source community.

There are specific [Unraid](https://unraid.net/) [installation instructions](https://github.com/kieraneglin/pinchflat?tab=readme-ov-file#unraid), which thanks to the great community around Unraid, was a breeze to install.

With Unraid I was able to use the Community App plugin, but other platforms are easy enough to install on as well. The tool is fairly intuitive and easy to use. I was able to download a few videos from YouTube without any issues. I am the type of person who tries first and then reads the manual, so I did not read the manual first. I was able to figure out how to use the tool without any issues.

I have a few people / channels that I follow on YouTube and I like to download the videos to watch later. This tool will make it easier to download the videos and watch them later.

I am also in the process of consuming a [DevOps Master Class](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nFr8RzQ4GIxUEznpNR53ERq) by John Savill so this was on the first items to be added to my list, works as expected and now allows me to watch the videos offline using JellyFin. Please make a point of liking and subscribing to John's channel, he has some great content. THen you can make the content available offline ðŸ˜Š.
